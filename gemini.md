
You are a senior front-end engineer and product-minded builder. Your task is to build a production-quality expense tracker web app using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks). You are running inside an agentic IDE that can create/edit files, run commands, and verify outputs.

Goal
Build a responsive, fast, offline-capable expense tracker that works as a static site (open index.html in a browser). Data must persist locally without a backend.

Non-negotiable constraints
- Tech: HTML5 + modern CSS + vanilla JS (ES2020+). No React/Vue/Angular. No build step required.
- Storage: localStorage (with versioned schema + safe migrations).
- Must run by opening index.html (or via a simple static server). Do not require Node runtime to use the app.
- Accessibility: keyboard navigable, proper focus states, semantic HTML, ARIA where needed, respects prefers-reduced-motion.
- Performance: keep JS modular and readable. Avoid unnecessary reflows and heavy DOM churn.
- Security: sanitize user input for rendering. Never use innerHTML with unsanitized strings.

Primary user story
“As a user, I can quickly log expenses/income, categorize them, and see clear summaries and trends by month.”

Core features (must implement)
1) Transactions CRUD
- Add transaction: type (Expense/Income), amount (decimal), category, date (default today), optional note, optional payment method.
- Edit transaction: same fields.
- Delete transaction with Undo (snackbar/toast) for at least 5 seconds.
- Validation: amount > 0, date valid, category required, type required.

2) Views
- Dashboard
  - This month: total income, total expense, net.
  - Category breakdown (top categories + “Other”).
  - Trend chart for daily spend or cumulative spend for the selected month.
- Transactions list
  - Sort by date (default desc), amount.
  - Filter by: date range, category, type.
  - Search by note text.
  - Group by day with subtotals.

3) Budgeting (simple but real)
- Monthly budget setting (single number).
- Budget progress indicator on dashboard (spent vs budget).
- Warning state when crossing 80% and 100%.

4) Data tools
- Export to CSV (transactions only).
- Import from JSON (validated; reject malformed entries with a readable error summary).
- Reset all data (with confirmation modal).

5) Settings
- Currency symbol (default ₹) and number formatting (use Intl.NumberFormat).
- Start-of-week toggle (Mon/Sun) for date displays where relevant (optional if time is tight).

UI requirements
- Default theme: matte black. Use CSS variables for tokens.
- Mobile-first layout, scales up to desktop.
- Clear hierarchy: cards for dashboard, table/list for transactions, modal/drawer for add/edit.
- Always-visible “Add” action (floating button on mobile, primary button on desktop).
- Provide empty states (no transactions, no search results) with clear CTAs.

Brand + styling baseline (implement now, can refine later)
- Matte black background with slightly lighter surfaces.
- High-contrast text. Avoid pure #000 and pure #FFF for large surfaces.
- One accent color for primary actions and highlights.
- Consistent radius, spacing scale, and subtle shadows (but keep it “matte”, not glossy).
- Respect reduced motion.

Project structure (create these files)
- /index.html
- /styles.css
- /app.js (as type="module")
- /storage.js (localStorage + migrations)
- /utils.js (formatting, ids, sanitization helpers)
- /README.md (setup, features, data schema, known limitations, manual test checklist)

Implementation details (make pragmatic choices)
- Data model (minimum):
  - id: string
  - type: "expense" | "income"
  - amount: number
  - category: string
  - date: ISO string "YYYY-MM-DD"
  - note: string
  - paymentMethod: string
  - createdAt: ISO datetime
  - updatedAt: ISO datetime
- Storage schema:
  - localStorage key: "expenseTracker:data"
  - include { version, settings, transactions }
  - implement migrate(oldData) -> newData with version increments

Charts
- Prefer implementing charts with native Canvas/SVG to avoid external dependencies.
- If you choose a CDN library, it must be optional and the app must still function without charts.

Quality bar
- No broken flows. No console errors.
- Clean separation of concerns: rendering, state, storage, utilities.
- Defensive coding for corrupted localStorage data (recover with a safe reset prompt).

Working process (follow this order)
1) Create a short plan in comments inside README.md (not in chat).
2) Scaffold the project structure and HTML layout.
3) Implement storage layer + migrations + settings.
4) Implement transactions CRUD + validation + undo delete.
5) Implement dashboard summaries.
6) Implement filters/search/sort.
7) Implement budget.
8) Implement export/import/reset.
9) Accessibility pass: focus traps in modals, keyboard shortcuts (Esc closes modal), aria-labels.
10) Final polish: empty states, responsive tweaks, reduced motion.

Output requirements
- Produce the complete working codebase in the specified structure.
- README.md must include:
  - Feature list
  - How to run (simple instructions)
  - Data schema + storage versioning
  - Manual test checklist (step-by-step)
  - Future improvements (short list)

If anything is ambiguous, make reasonable assumptions and proceed. Do not ask questions unless a decision blocks progress.
